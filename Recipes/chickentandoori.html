    <h1>TANDOORI CHICKEN:</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Try this authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home. Serve with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the cob, and a cucumber salad.</p>

    <ul><h3>The Ingredients are:</h3>
    <Li>2 pounds chicken, cut into pieces</Li>
    <Li>1 medium lemon, juiced</Li>
    <Li>1 teaspoon salt</Li>
    <Li>1 ¼ cups plain yogurt</Li>
    <Li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</Li>
    <Li>1 clove garlic, minced</Li>
    <Li>2 teaspoons garam masala</Li>
    <Li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</Li>
    <Li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</Li>
    <Li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</Li>
    <Li>1 teaspoon yellow food coloring (Optional)</Li>
    <Li>2 teaspoons finely chopped cilantro</Li>
    <Li>1 medium lemon, cut into wedges</Li>
</ul>

    <h2><ol type="1">Steps:</h2>
    <Li type="1">Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt. Let sit for 20 minutes.

    </Li>

    <Li type="1">Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring. Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).

    </Li>

    <Li type="1">When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade.</Li>
    
    <Li type="1">Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.
